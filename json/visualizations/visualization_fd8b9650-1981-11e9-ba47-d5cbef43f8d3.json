By using this panel we can identify and analyze behaviors of specific organizations, projects or repositories.\\n\\nThere are some filters added by default:\\n* `NOT Merges`: It ignores those commits whose number of modified files is 0 (this is, commits from merges).\\n* `NOT Bots`: It ignores those commits whose author is marked as a Bot.\\n\\nHere is the [link to the full documentation](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-sigils/chaoss-gmd-cde/lines_of_code_changed/) for this panel.\"},\"aggs\":[]}"
