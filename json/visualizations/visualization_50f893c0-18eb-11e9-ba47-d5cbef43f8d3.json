Periods of time where the growth has been positive are represented in green, while periods with negative growth are displayed in yellow.\\n* **Bottom right evolutionary chart** displays the number of contributors over time. Red line displays the average of the community in the timeframe of analysis. The bars represents how far that period of time is from the average. The value of each bar is the difference between the number of contributors in that slot of time and the average of contributors for that period of time.\\n* **Table** splits all of this information by data source. This gives the number contributors.\\n\\n[See complete panel documentation](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-sigils/panels/contributors-growth/)\"},\"aggs\":[]}"
