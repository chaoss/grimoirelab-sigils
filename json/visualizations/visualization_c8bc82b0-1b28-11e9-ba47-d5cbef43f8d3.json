In this case, we focus on GitHub pull requests. \\n\\nWhen measuring GitHub, we cannot identify if a pull request has been `merged`, only if is `open` or `closed`. That's the reason why **we will base our panel on pull request closing time**.\\n\\nThe main idea behind this panel is to help us identify a **project state (growth maturity or decline)** by answering custom queries like:\\n- **How long** does a code merge request take in order to be committed?\\n- What organizations/authors **are being more efficient** when closing a pull request?\\n- Is my project **taking too long** when closing code merge requests?\\n\\nHere is the [link to the full documentation](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-sigils/chaoss-gmd-cde/pull_request_merge_duration/) for this panel.\"},\"aggs\":[]}"
