These panels contain information about evolution of Issues in time. Although it
shows submitters, repositories and domains as previous GitHub panels, here we
focus on how long Issues remain open.  Thus, we can work with
this panel in a similar way for filtering, but dealing with different information.

Among other information we can find statistical information on closing times and
also tables with the latest and the oldest Issues.
