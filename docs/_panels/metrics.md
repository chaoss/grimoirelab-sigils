This document covers the basic metrics shown in current Grimoire Lab dashboards and how the user can filter
and drill-down into details.

## Activity

Activity is defined by the events occurring in the project (activities), such commits, changesets, messages, etc.

**Total activity**

Represented as a number, it shows for the selected period of time, the total number of events occurred in such period.

If the item can have different status (e.g. open or close) or the people that generates the item, can be grouped
in a countable number of categories (organizations, email addresses, etc.), total activity can be shown as a
pie or doughnut chart.

**Evolution over time**

For the selected period of time, it's the number of events occurring over time by periods of time (days, weeks, months, years).

![Single item evolution]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/activity-single-evolution.jpg)

If events can have different status, the chart will show the number of events occurring over time by periods of time by status.
For example: issues openned and issues closed.

If events can have different origin (organization, repository, etc.), the evolution over time can be represented
by colored bar chart.

## Community

Community is defined by the people that do activities in the project.

Performance metrics are related with time to close tickets, time to answer emails, development cycle total time, etc.

**Average, median, percentiles**

**Percentiles over time**

**Accumulated open time**

**Backlog Management Index**
