This panel focuses on pending tasks, that is, those Issues and Pull Requests
that remain open (note that here we work with data retrieved in the moment of
dashboard creation).

It is possible to see Issues and Pull Requests together or filter them by using
the Activity donut on the top left corner. It is also possible to filter data
in the same way as in other GitHub panels (by submitter, repository and domain).

A list with the oldest Issues and Pull Requests is also shown, providing direct
links to them and some basic information as their titles, how long they have
been open and when they were created.
