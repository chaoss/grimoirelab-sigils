description: activity and community metrics focused on Issues.
layout: panel

GitHub Issues panels show information related to how community evolves in terms
of submitters, domains and activity.

These panels show activity by domains and repositories. Each issue has a creation
date and closing date, and of course a state (open or closed). We measure
activity based on the amount of tickets created over time and their states.

This way, we can filter to get activity information related to a given submitter,
domain or/and repository.
