This panel offers a view of efficiency closing issues based on three metrics:
* **BMI**: Backlog Management Index, defined as the number of closed issues divided
by the number of open ones in a given period of time. Measures efficiency closing issues.
* **Lead Time**: the time between the initiation and completion of a production
process, in this case, an issue. Shown in average in this panel.
* **Time to Close**: time from issue creation to the moment in which it's closed.

###### Figure 1.GitLab Issues Efficiency Panel

Filtering by Organization and Project is allowed by using the top left corner
widget.

**BMI** is shown next to filtering widget. Moving average is set to 8 weeks
to identify changes in trends. Average is also shown as reference. BMI values
greater than 1 means the community is closing more tickets than those they are
opening. Values smaller than 1 means the opposite, i.e., more tickets open than
those closed during a given time frame.

**Median Time to Close** gauge is set to show green color for less than 7 days, yellow
for values from 7 to 30 days and red from 30 to 90 days. This means we are
considering a week as a good time to close. This is just a visual reference and
you can always rely on the number, ignoring this color scheme.

Next to this gauge, **Lead Time** shows the average Time to Close together to its
trend. This helps to identify peaks and visualize the global evolution of time
spent in closing issues.

Finally, a table on the right splits **Median Time to Close** by repository,
giving an insight on the differences among them.
