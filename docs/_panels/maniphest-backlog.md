This dashboard focuses on pending tasks, that is, those Issues
that remain open (note that here we work with data retrieved in the moment of
dashboard creation).

It is possible to filter data in the same way as in other Maniphest panels
(by submitter, project, and status).

A list with the oldest Issues is also shown providing some basic information as their titles,
how long they have been open and when they were created.

## Metrics

The metrics provided are:

* **Open Issues Statistics**: total numbers of open issues, accumulated open days, and the average time
the issues have been open (days).
* **Backlog (Open Issues)**: a table separated by the title of the issues that details the task submitter,
maniphest project, open date, number of updates, and the number of comments.
* **Backlog**: a bar chart that shows the evolution of the issues.
* **Backlog: Issues (Accumulated Time)**: a bar chart that shows the evolution of the accumulated
open issues (days).
* **Assignee Organizations**: a pie chart that summarizes the issues by the assignees' organization.
* **Backlog Submitters**: a table sorted by submitters that details the number of issues, average time the issues
have been open (days), and projects.
* **Organizations**: a table sorted by organizations that details the number of open issues, submitters, assignees,
and the average time the issues have been open (days).
* **Projects**: a table sorted by projects that details the number of open issues and the average time the issues
