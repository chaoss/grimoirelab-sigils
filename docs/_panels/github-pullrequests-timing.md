description: metrics focused on how long pull requests remain open.
layout: panel

These panels contain information about evolution of Pull Requests in time.
Although it shows submitters, repositories and domains as previous GitHub panels,
here we focus on how long Pull Requests remain open.  Thus, we can work with
this panel in a similar way for filtering, but dealing with different information.

Among other information we can find statistical information on closing times and
also tables with the latest and the oldest Pull Requests.
