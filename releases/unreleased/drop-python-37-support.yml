title: Drop Python 3.7 support
category: removed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  Python 3.7 reaches the end of life in June 2023. This means it
  won't receive new updates or patches to fix security issues.
  Therefore, this package only works with Python >= 3.8 from now on.
